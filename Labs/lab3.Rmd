## HIV prevalence from WHO

- The HIV prevalence data from lab 2 was modified from its raw form. 
In this lab we will work with the raw data.

- A spreadsheet of the data `HIVprevRaw.csv` is available in the Labs folder of the class GitHub repository. We 
can read in these data as follows (we'll learn about reading in data in week 5):

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
hiv <- read.csv("HIVprevRaw.csv",stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

- Take a look at the top few lines of raw data.

```{r}
head(hiv)
```

- Make a copy of `hiv` for use in exercise 4.

```{r}
hivcopy <- hiv
```


- In exercises 1 - 3, save the results of each data manipulation in 
`hiv`. In exercise 4  you will use the copy `hivcopy`.

1. The first column of the data frame is the country, but it
has been named`Estimated.HIV.Prevalence.....Ages.15.49.1`.
Use the `rename()` function to rename this column  `Country`.
```{r}
hivcopy <- rename(hivcopy, Country = Estimated.HIV.Prevalence.....Ages.15.49.)
```

2. The data from 1979 to 1989 is very sparse. Remove these
columns from the data frame.
```{r}
select(hivcopy, -(X1979:X1989))
```

3. Sort the data in descending order of prevalence in 2011. Print the first 6 rows of 
your final data set.
```{r}
hivcopy <- arrange(hivcopy, desc(X2011))
head(hivcopy, n = 6)
```

4. Use the copy `hivcopy` and the forward pipe to chain the data manipulations 
of exercises 1-3.
